## Overview

This Terraform configuration sets up a basic infrastructure on AWS, consisting of:
- An EC2 instance running on Amazon Linux AMI.
- An Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) configured to distribute traffic across instances.
- Uses default VPC, subnets, and security groups for simplicity.

## Files Overview

1. **data.tf**: 
   - Fetches AWS data sources like default VPC, subnets, security group, and AMI.
   - Ensures that resources are deployed within the existing AWS infrastructure.

2. **ec2.tf**: 
   - Defines an EC2 instance using the fetched AMI and subnet details.
   - Allows customization of the instance type and name via variables.

3. **elb.tf**: 
   - Creates an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) in the specified availability zones.
   - Configures listeners, health checks, and load balancing settings.
   - Associates the ELB with the EC2 instance.

4. **output.tf**: 
   - Specifies output values for the public IP of the EC2 instance and the DNS name of the ELB.

5. **provider.tf**: 
   - Configures the AWS provider with the specified region and AWS profile.

6. **variables.tf**: 
   - Defines input variables for customizing resources like EC2 instance type, ELB settings, and other configurations.

7. **versions.tf**: 
   - Specifies the required versions of Terraform and the AWS provider.

8. **terraform.tfvars**: 
   - Contains default values for input variables to simplify deployment.

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) >= 1.9.0
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) configured with appropriate permissions.
- AWS account with access to create VPCs, EC2 instances, and ELBs.

## Setup

Before deploying the resources, ensure you have the following configured:

1. **AWS Credentials**: Configure your AWS credentials using the AWS CLI or environment variables.

2. **Terraform Installation**: Install Terraform using the instructions on the [official Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

## Deployment

To deploy the resources defined in this Terraform project, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the Terraform workspace:**

   ```bash
   terraform init

2. **Validate the Terraform code:**
    ```bash
    terraform validate

3. **Plan the deployment to see the resources that will be created:**
    
    ```bash
    terraform plan

4. **Apply the configuration to deploy the resources:**    

    ```bash
    terraform apply

## Cleanup

**Destroy the infrastructure:**    
    
    ```bash
    terraform destroy

Confirm the destruction by typing yes when prompted. This will remove all the resources created by the Terraform configuration.
